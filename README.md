The Requirement is as follows

Using the browser Geolocation API, find the current user location and query google place API
to fetch nearby restaurants list. 

The list of design requirements include:
1. A map view with interactive pins that on hover reveal more information about the selected
restaurant.

2. A list view of restaurants that includes restaurant details such as name, rating, address,
photo, open timing, top reviews, price ($$$$), and number (which corresponds to a location
on the map).

3. A control panel that allows a user to filter restaurants by distance, price, and rating.(under construction)
